// We are a team of Japanese fashion enthusiasts aiming for a more understanding and open-minded society, where fashion plays a crucial rol. We believe that fashion has built individual and collective identities for a long time. Now it's time for fashion to melt and adapt itself to new shapes, colors, features and fabrics. That is why in Sakura Kimonos we support the investigation and development of more environmentally responsible products, pacgkaging and commit to create sustainable importing routes. There is no planet B and Sakura Kimonos stands for responsible productions methods in order to reduce waste. We work with natural textile dyes and offers a wide variety of vegan fabrics options to choose from. Got any suggestion? We are here to listen and learn!
